					MAVEN
					=====
1) Write maven life cycle and its commands
* Maven is a powerful project tool that is based on project object model used for project bulid, 
dependency and documentation.

MAVEN LIFECYCLE:
---------------
* There are 8 steps in the leftcycle of maven
-Validate: It checks if all the dependencies have been downloaded and are available in the local
repository. 
-Compile:It compiles the source code, convert the .java files to .class and stores the classes in 
target/classes folder.
-Test: It runs unit tests for the project.
-Package:This step packages the compiled code in distributable format like JAR or WAR.
-Integration Test: It runs the integration tests for the project is valid and meets the quality 
standards.
-Verify: This step runs checks to verify that project is valid and meets the quality standards.
-Install: This step installs the packaged code to the local maven repository.
-Deploy: It copies the packaged code to the remote repository for sharing it with other developers.

MAVEN COMMANDS:
---------------
* mvn clean: cleans the project and removes all files generated by the previous build.
* mvn compile: Compiles source code of the project.
* mvn test-compile :Compiles the test source code.
* mvn test: Runs tests for the project.
* mvn package: Creates JAR or WAR file for the project to convert it into a distributable format.
* mvn install: Deploys the packaged JAR/WAR file to the local repository.
* mvn depoly: Copies the packaged JAR/WAR file to the remote repository after compiling,running
  tests and building the project.

2) Describe about 
a)mvn --version: it will show which version we are using.And maven is a software project 
 management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), 
 Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central place. 
 The core release is independent of plugin releases.

b)mvn --compile: The compiler plugin is used to compile the source code of a Maven project. 
This plugin has two goals, which are already bound to specific phases of the default lifecycle,
 compile – compile main source files. testCompile – compile test source files.

c)mvn --test: Maven is the latest build testing tool. It has several new features like dependency,etc. 
Maven is a project build or project management tool.It is used to check the compilation issues 
between framework components whenever multiple test engineer integrates their files into the same 
framework.

d)mvn --install: mvn install. adds all artifact (dependencies) specified in pom, 
to the local repository (from remote sources)

e)mvn --clean: he Maven Clean Plugin, as the name implies, attempts to clean the files and 
directories generated by Maven during its build. While there are plugins that generate additional
 files, the Clean Plugin assumes that these files are generated inside the target directory.

3)What is WEB services?
*Web services, as the name suggests, is simply a software system that is specially designed to 
propagate communication between the client and server applications on WWW (World Wide Web). 
In simple words, it is the method of communication among two or more devices over a network.
=====================================================================================================

4)what is rest controller?
*RestController is a Spring annotation that is used to build REST API in a declarative way. 
RestController annotation is applied to a class to mark it as a request handler,
and Spring will do the building and provide the RESTful web service at runtime.
=====================================================================================================
5)Web services and its methods: get , post , put, delete ? describe its  
*GET is used to request data from a specified resource. 
GET requests can be cached. GET requests remain in the browser history.
*The POST request adds a new resource to the server, while the PUT request replaces an existing 
resource on the server. For example, the HTTP POST request method is used by browsers when 
submitting HTML form data to the server or when submitting data using jQuery/AJAX requests.
*PUT method is used to update resource available on the server. Typically, it replaces whatever 
exists at the target URL with something else. You can use it to make a new resource or overwrite 
an existing one.
*The HTTP DELETE method is used to delete a resource from the server.
